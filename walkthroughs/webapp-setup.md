# Run Your WebApp

This short walkthrough is for learning how to run your web app.

## Express.js

In order to host our web app, we have set up the initial routing for the website using Express.js - a Node.js webapp framework.

First, please install Node.js and npm from https://nodejs.org/en/download/ if you have not previously used Node.js. 

Once you do this, run `npm start` and visit localhost:3000 in your browser.

If you run into an error, be sure you are in the correct folder (should be your repository's main folder) and that you have installed Node.js 

If it still doesn't work, please uninstall and install express on your local computer using these commands in your terminal:

```bash
npm uninstall express
```

```bash
npm install express --save
```

## VSCode and Live Share Extension

We recommend you use VSCode as your IDE because it has a super handy extension called Live Share! This lets a group of people all edit code at the same time like a Google Doc, even allowing participants to type in the host's terminal and view shared servers (like localhost:3000!). 

Download VSCode from https://code.visualstudio.com/download

Live Share Extension Details: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare-pack
- You can install the extension from VSCode directly by clicking on the Extensions icon on the left menu. If you search "Live Share" it should be the first thing that pops up. You will need to restart VSCode after installation.
- Let us know if you need any help! Otherwise all the information you need should be found in the two links above. 

## Color Palette

Now it's time to choose a color palette for your website! 

Please choose a palette from this website or any other palette website you like to use :)

[Color Hunt](https://colorhunt.co/)

You should primarily use these colors for the main components of your web application so be sure to bookmark the palette you choose!

## You're Set!

Perfect, now you're ready to get into building the webapp! 

Please ask for help if you are running into issues before moving forward. Otherwise, feel free to get started on your UI mockup!
